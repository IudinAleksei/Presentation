            <aside class="notes">
              React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who released an early prototype of React called "FaxJS". 
              He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. 
              It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012. 
              It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013

          <h2>Virtual DOM</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Re-rendering the whole app on every update is not efficient</li>
            <li>The Virtual DOM will only update what is necessary</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            Another notable feature is the use of a virtual Document Object Model, or virtual DOM. 
            React creates an in-memory data-structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed DOM efficiently. 
            This process is called reconciliation. 
            This allows the programmer to write code as if the entire page is rendered on each change, while the React libraries only render subcomponents that actually change. 
            This selective rendering provides a major performance boost. It saves the effort of recalculating the CSS style, layout for the page and rendering for the entire page.

          <h2>JSX</h2>
            <p>JSX, or JavaScript XML , is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax.</p>
            <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
              const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world&lt;/h1&gt;;
              ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
            </code></pre>
            <ul>
              <li>Allows you to focus on building components, not templates</li>
              <li>Combining Markup and JavaScript reduces context switching</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.
              JSX, or JavaScript XML , is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax. 
              Similar in appearance to HTML, JSX provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. 
              React components are typically written using JSX, although they do not have to be (components may also be written in pure JavaScript).
