            Hello everyone!
            Today you will hear a short story about React.

          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>React was created by Jordan Walke</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              I want to start with the basic historical facts.
              React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who released an early prototype of React called "FaxJS". 
              He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. 
              It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012. 
              It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013

              And? What Is React?
              React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

            Declarative.
            React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in application, 
            and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when data changes.
            Declarative views make code more predictable and easier to debug.
            It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

              Now, few words about JSX.
              This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.

              <ul>
                <li>Allows you to focus on building components, not templates</li>
                <li>Combining Markup and JavaScript reduces context switching</li>

                JSX, or JavaScript XML , is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax. 
                Similar in appearance to HTML, JSX provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. 
                React components are typically written using JSX, although they do not have to be (components may also be written in pure JavaScript).

          <h2>Virtual DOM</h2>
          <img src="assets/virtualDOM.png" alt="user interface" height="300px">
          <ul>
            <li>Re-rendering the whole app on every update is not efficient</li>
            <li>The Virtual DOM will only update what is necessary</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            Another notable feature is the use of a virtual Document Object Model, or virtual DOM. 
            React creates an in-memory data-structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed DOM efficiently. 
            This process is called reconciliation. 
            This allows the programmer to write code as if the entire page is rendered on each change, while the React libraries only render subcomponents that actually change. 
            This selective rendering provides a major performance boost. It saves the effort of recalculating the CSS style, layout for the page and rendering for the entire page.

          <h2>Flexible</h2>
          <p>You can use as little or as much React as you need</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. 
            Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app.

          <aside class="notes">
            And in conclusion I would like to quote the words of the React developers:
            React is, in our opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript.
